To make available the model, we'll use ngrok to expose a single endpoint to make predictions online.\n","\n","## Introduction to the business scenario\n","\n","You work for a healthcare provider, and want to improve the detection of abnormalities in orthopedic patients.\n","\n","You are tasked with solving this problem by using machine learning (ML). You have access to a dataset that contains six biomechanical features and a target of _normal_ or _abnormal_. You can use this dataset to train an ML model to predict if a patient will have an abnormality.\n","\n","## About this dataset\n","\n","This biomedical dataset was built by Dr. Henrique da Mota during a medical residence period in the Group of Applied Research in Orthopaedics (GARO) of the Centre Médico-Chirurgical de Réadaptation des Massues, Lyon, France. The data has been organized in two different, but related, classification tasks.\n","\n","The first task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one of three categories:\n","\n","- _Normal_ (100 patients)\n","- _Disk Hernia_ (60 patients)\n","- _Spondylolisthesis_ (150 patients)\n","\n","For the second task, the categories _Disk Hernia_ and _Spondylolisthesis_ were merged into a single category that is labeled as _abnormal_. Thus, the second task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one of two categories: _Normal_ (100 patients) or _Abnormal_ (210 patients).\n","\n","## Attribute information\n","\n","Each patient is represented in the dataset by six biomechanical attributes that are derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine (in this order):\n","\n","- Pelvic incidence\n","- Pelvic tilt\n","- Lumbar lordosis angle\n","- Sacral slope\n","- Pelvic radius\n","- Grade of spondylolisthesis\n","\n","The following convention is used for the class labels:\n","\n","- DH (Disk Hernia)\n","- Spondylolisthesis (SL)\n","- Normal (NO)\n","- Abnormal (AB)\n","\n","For more information about this dataset, see the [Vertebral Column dataset webpage](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Vertebral+Column).\n","\n","## Dataset attributions\n","\n","This dataset was obtained from:\n","Dua, D. and Graff, C.
